Plugin for intelliJ that will make the frontend development a bit handy,
it works by making an automatic conversion from px to rem & px to em,
you can also choose the base value that will be used for the conversion.

### How to use it
First of all you must choose the base value to make the conversion by pressing 
```CTRL + ALT + Q```

Then in your css page selecting the text that you want to convert,
just press ```CTRL + ALT + E``` to convert to EM, 

or ```CTRL + ALT + R``` to convert is to REM.

### Google it
There's another functionality that sometimes can save us some time, 

by select any text or phrase in the project and press ```CTRL + ALT + G``` you can google it easier.
